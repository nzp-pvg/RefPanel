This project benchmarks an input free plasma methylome sequencing workflow by constructing a healthy reference panel and using it to systematically explore and optimize analysis parameters across cohorts. It evaluates how normalization strategies and key methodological choices influence case control separability, and it delivers a reproducible cross cohort tuning and performance assessment framework using consistent readouts such as PCA shift patterns and classification AUC.
